    "Explanation:\n",
    "A subsequence of a string is derived by deleting some or none of its characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. In this problem, we are given two strings s and t, and we need to find how many distinct subsequences of s match t.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define a DP table dp[i][j] that represents the number of ways to match the first j characters of t in the first i characters of s.\n",

    "We can skip s[i-1] and still try to match t[0..j] with s[0..i-1], so the number of ways is dp[i-1][j].\n",
